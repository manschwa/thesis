# Hint: Most bibtex styles change the title to lowercase (except for the first character).
#       In our opinion, this does not make sense - regardless the language --, since the
#       title is a *quote* and should be printed exactly as in the cited paper.
#       Putting the title in brackets (as shown below) prevents this behaviour.
